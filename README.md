# Troubleshooting Basics
### Hello Everyone, This is my 3rd year in computer science and i felt that i should atleast have some of the experience in basics. So enough of ML/AI now and getting back to work on those machines which runs these codes. Hence trying my hands on troubleshooting and Solution planning. 
### This git repo is a documentation for my troubleshooting journey because i eventually ran out of space :)
