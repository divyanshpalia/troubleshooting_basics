# Troubleshooting Basics
### Hello Everyone, This is my 3rd year in computer science and i felt that i should atleast have some of the experience in basics. So enough of ML/AI now and getting back to work on those machines which runs these codes. Hence trying my hands on troubleshooting and Solution planning.

This git repo is a documentation for my troubleshooting journey because i eventually ran out of space :)

### This is how it's going.
Day 1 : Learnt about IT , computers , Alan Turing and the god himself Charles.B also glad to know that the first algorithm was made by a woman. Damn women always know steps to solve a problem.

Day 2 : Got the basics between Software and Hardware and how troubleshooting is different for both of them.
